paramount-ng
============

Based on [my personal fork of paramount][3], which was based on:

- [owickstrom/vim-colors-paramount][1]
- ...which itself is based on [vim-colors-paramount][2].

Built using [Lush][4].

Install
=======

IDK, I use packer.

```lua
use {
  "chrsm/paramount-ng.nvim",
  requires = { "rktjmp/lush.nvim" }
}
```
